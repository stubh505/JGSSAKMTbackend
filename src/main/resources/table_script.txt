Sri Gurudev Ashok Kumar Mukhopadhyay left His body of flesh and blood plunging us in grief and distress. The disciples, devotees, relatives
followers discussed in a meeting that, we should preserve the house where our Sri Gurudev lived His last life and which is His named property (as
He saw with His mortal eyes), and we must form an organization (as He desired) under His name and the object of the said organization would be to
follow His Lessons. This is how “Joy Guru Sri Sri Ashok Kumar Mukhopadhyay Seva Kendra Trust” saw daylight on the auspicious day of the 4th of
August 2004. Sri Gurudev was born to this world on 4th February 1950 on the banks of Holy Ganges in Ballavpur Street in Srirampur, Bengal. The
mission of our beloved Sri Gurudev was to donate even His last penny to the actually needy people, whoever He may be and without considering the
cast and creed. The Trust has been maintaining that tradition to fulfil Gurudev’s wishes.</p>", "", 1001);
