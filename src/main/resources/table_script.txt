<p style="text-align: justify;">Sri Ramakrishna was born to a pious brahmin family in the inland village of Kamarpukur on the second lunar day of the bright fortnight of Phalgun. The village is in the Hooghly district, about eight miles west of Jehanabad (Aram Bag) and about twenty-six miles south of Burdwan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a difference of opinion on the date of his birth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During Sri Ramakrishna&rsquo;s illness, Ambika Acharya read his horoscope and dated his birth on the third of Kartik, 1286 B.Y., A.D. 1879. This gives a date of 1756 Shaka, the 10th of Phalgun, Wednesday, the second day of the bright fortnight, Purva Bhadrapada Nakshatra. His calculation is: 1756/109/59/12. On the other hand Kshetra Nath Bhatt&rsquo;s calculation in 1300 B.Y. is 1754/10/9/0/12. According to this calculation it is 1754 Shaka, the 10th of Phalgun, Wednesday, the second day of the bright fortnight, Purva Bhadrapada, 1239 B.Y., 20 February 1833. All tally. At this time there is a conjunction of the sun, the moon, and Mercury. It is the sign of Aquarius. Because of the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus, he would be the chief of a religious sect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Narayana Jyotirbhushan made a new horoscope (at Belur Math). According to his calculation, 1242 B.Y., 6th of Phalgun, Wednesday; 17 February 1836, 4 a.m., the second day of the bright fortnight of Phalgun, when there is a conjunction of the three planets, all the points tally except the 10 of Phalgun given by Ambika Acharya: 1757/10/5/59/28/21. Sri Ramakrishna lived for fifty years. Thakur&rsquo;s father, Sri Khudiram Chatterji, was a man of firm faith and great devotion. His mother, Chandramani Devi, was the personification of simplicity and kindness. They had lived in a village called Dere about three miles from Kamarpukur, but because of problems relating to Khudiram&rsquo;s refusal to give evidence in a lawsuit in favour of the landlord at Dere, he moved to Kamarpukur with his family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sri Ramakrishna&rsquo;s childhood name was Gadadhar. He learned elementary reading in primary school but the arithmetic book by Shuvankara confused him, so he left school to stay at home and attend to the household deity, Raghuvir. He himself plucked flowers for worship and performed the daily puja.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His voice was exquisitely sweet, and he could sing almost all the songs he heard in theatrical performances.He was cheerful from childhood. Everyone in the neighbourhood &ndash; men and women and children &ndash; loved him dearly and felt the attraction of his cheerful nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Holy men frequently visited a guesthouse at the garden of the Lahas, near Gadadhar&rsquo;s home. He would visit them there and serve them. And when the storytellers read from the Puranas, he would listen with rapt attention. In this way he learned all the stories of the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Srimad Bhagavata.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One day when he was eleven years old, Thakur crossed a field to Anur, a nearby village. He later narrated how he had suddenly lost all sense- consciousness when he saw a miraculous light. People thought he had fainted, but he had attained the superconscious state of bhava samadhi.</p>', 'Sri Sri Ramakrishna
